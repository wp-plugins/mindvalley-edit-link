== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the edit bar. =

It will only appear on single posts / pages.


= I don't see the edit bar, even on a single post / page. =

The code attaches to 'wp_footer', so make sure your footer file calls wp_footer() to activate it.

Check for Javascript errors or CSS overwrites.
